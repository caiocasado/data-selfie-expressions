# Data Selfie App - with face expression analysis using face-api.js
> Here I am is a little web application that allows you to submit an image of your self along with your geolocation. This app is a nice starting point for other self-tracking applications or just a standalone application to create a collection of "dataselfies" with some extra metadata.

(NOTE: face expression analysis has its biases based on it's training data. Machines can only learn from what they've been given!)
